 *
 * The ESP32-S3 DevKitC does not have a dedicated user LED.
 * The DevKitC-N8R8 and similar variants have an addressable RGB LED on GPIO48.
 * For a simple GPIO LED, we use GPIO38 which is exposed on the header.
 * 
 * Hardware connection required:
 *   GPIO38 -> LED -> 330R -> GND
 *
 * If using the onboard RGB LED (WS2812), you would need the LED Strip driver
 * instead of simple GPIO. This overlay provides a simple GPIO LED for testing.
