# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here.

## Unreleased

## 2.0.0-rc.3 - 2026-09-01

- Closed the remaining source-truth gaps: project schemas reject persisted
  credentials, migration documentation matches explicit Studio Save behavior,
  and release records are checkout-bound.
- Source and local non-HIL gates are closed. Hosted exact-tag/SHA artifact
  generation remains execution evidence until the workflow runs; REL-007
  traceable physical HIL remains the only pending product-qualification gate.

## 2.0.0-rc.2 - 2026-08-31

- Closed the non-HIL release gates: exact-SHA reusable CI checkouts, restricted
  AI/MCP regression coverage, deterministic Lab/Learn evidence, and truthful
  RC2 release records.
- Release publishing now verifies the bundled Windows native runtime alongside
  both distributables and the unpacked application; the aggregate bundle is
  named publishable rather than signed because Linux is not natively signed.
- The remaining qualification gate is traceable physical HIL on the selected
  Pico RP2040 and ESP32-S3 profiles. This RC is not GA, production-qualified,
  or a safety certification.

## 2.0.0-rc.1 - 2026-08-31

- Hardened program loader, persistence, scheduler, and transport trust boundaries.
- Added canonical compiler, project, and Tool API contracts, plus supervised native
  simulation and the redesigned Studio workbench.
- Added restricted AI/MCP, Lab, and Learn foundations, and reproducible packaging
  and release-evidence plumbing.
- **Breaking C API:** `zplc_core_load_raw` and `zplc_mem_load_code` are no
  longer exported. Product artifact-admission routes must use verified
  `zplc_core_load` or `zplc_core_load_tasks`; `zplc_vm_*` remains a low-level
  trusted-embedder API, and its embedder owns verification before supplying or
  modifying code.

This RC is not GA and does not establish HIL, board qualification, or safety
certification. Hosted workflow evidence and human sign-off remain required.
