## Unreleased

- **Breaking C API:** `zplc_core_load_raw` and `zplc_mem_load_code` are no
  longer exported. Product artifact-admission routes must use verified
  `zplc_core_load` or `zplc_core_load_tasks`; `zplc_vm_*` remains a low-level
  trusted-embedder API, and its embedder owns verification before supplying or
  modifying code.
