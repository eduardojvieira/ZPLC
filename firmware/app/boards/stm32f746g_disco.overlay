 * The STM32F746G-DISCO already defines:
 *   - led0 = green_led_1 (PI1)
 *   - sw0 = user_button (PI11)
 *   - storage_partition on QSPI flash (external N25Q128A)
 *
 * The board already has NVS storage configured on external QSPI,
 * so no additional overlay configuration is needed for persistence.
 *
 * This overlay is kept minimal as the base DTS provides everything needed.
