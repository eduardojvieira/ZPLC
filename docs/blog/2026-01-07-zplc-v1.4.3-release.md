We are excited to announce the release of **ZPLC v1.4.3**, a major update that brings the compiler significantly closer to full IEC 61131-3 compliance. This release focuses on advanced data structures and user-defined types.

<!--truncate-->

## Key Features

### User-Defined STRUCTs

You can now define your own data structures to organize complex data.

```st
TYPE MotorData : 
    STRUCT
        Speed : REAL;
        Direction : BOOL;
    END_STRUCT;
END_TYPE
```

### Multidimensional Arrays

Support for arrays up to 3 dimensions is now fully implemented.

```st
VAR
    Matrix : ARRAY[0..4, 0..4] OF REAL;
END_VAR

Matrix[1, 2] := 3.14;
```

### User-Defined Functions & Function Blocks

Define your own reusable logic blocks (`FUNCTION` and `FUNCTION_BLOCK`) and instantiate them in your programs.

### Global Variables

Share data between tasks easily with `VAR_GLOBAL`.

## What's Next?

We are working on further optimizations and expanding the Standard Library in the upcoming v1.5.0 release.

Happy Coding!
